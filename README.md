# HNB Webapp Clone (Practice Project)

This project is a **practice clone** of the HNB web application, built during my early frontend learning journey in **April 2023**.  
It was part of my university **pre-academic assignments** and helped me gain hands-on experience with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

##  Project Context
- Implemented in April 2023 as a practice project.  
- Only a few parts of the full system were developed, mainly focusing on the **UI**.  
- Reflects the **UI design available in 2023**, not the current HNB system.  
- Recently uploaded to GitHub — commits are not representative of the original development timeline since I wasn’t familiar with Git at that time.  

##  Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Framework: Bootstrap 5.3.0
- Icons: Bootstrap Icons
- Features: Responsive design, Form validation

##  Purpose
The main goal of this project was to:
- Learn and practice basic **frontend development concepts**.  
- Understand how to structure UI components.  
- Get familiar with creating small projects independently.  

## ⚠ Disclaimer
This is **not an official HNB project**.  
It is only a **learning-oriented clone** built for practice and educational purposes.
